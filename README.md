# Akai APC-Key-25 Chataigne-Module

this module controls the Akai APC-Key-25 via MIDI
in the Values-Section you'll find the Pads and the Knobs and the Keys
you can set the colors for each Pad
the Keys are playable on +/- 4 octaves; Middel-C is Key-12 with the Octave-Shift set to 0
if you change the Octave on the keyboard you have to set the same Octave-Shift in the Chataigne-Module

for instance the Shift-Pads functions are not yet working...
I'll add them in the next version..._

this script is based on the APC-MINI script written by Boris Lukrate...
