# Akai APC-Key-25 Chataigne-Module

this module controls the Akai APC-Key-25 via MIDI   
in the Values-Section you'll find the Pads and the Knobs and the Keys and the Function-Buttons   
you can set the colors for each Pad and also for the Function-Buttons (please note that the Transport-Buttons, the StopAll and the Shift-Button don't have any Color capacity)

the Keys are playable on +/- 4 octaves; Middel-C is Key-12 with the Octave-Shift set to 0   
if you change the Octave on the keyboard you have to set the same Octave-Shift in the Chataigne-Module   

###updated to new Version 1.3  
and added some more features
Please note that you can display the "Default Actions" which are currently hidden, by editing the "module.json"-file...  
Open it in a Text-Editer, go to Line where you will see :  "hideDefaultCommands":true, and change "true" to "false" and you're done !    
at the next restart of Chataigne the Default-Action will show up in the Actions-Menu

***Older version : 1.1***
